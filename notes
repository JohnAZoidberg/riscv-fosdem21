- History of the implementation
  - Start 2016 by Abner
  - Implemented QEMU PC/AT-compatible system with RISC-V, abandoned because ... why?
  - OpenSBI

- Architecture of EDK2 on RISC-V
  - SEC
  - PEI
  - DXE

- Booting Linux
  - Cooperation with Atish (OpenSBI)
  - No disk
    - HiFiveUnleashed only has SD but we don't have a driver for that
    - QEMU can use virtio but we haven't integrated PCI and virtio drivers
    -> No disk
    -> Embed bootloader and kernel into FW image
  - Atish was in the process of implementing RISC-V UEFI stub for Linux
    We tested together and made sure it works

- Goals for the future of this implementation
  - BeagleV [3]
  - FWTS (?)

Qs to Abner:
- Tell me about the history
- Anything special you want to include?
- Do we lock PMP at the end of PEI? Comment says so but I can't find anything

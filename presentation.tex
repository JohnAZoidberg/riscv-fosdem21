\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{frame}{Agenda}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item UEFI on RISC-V
      % Explain what this is all about
      % That we ported the reference implementation of UEFI, namely EDK2 to RISC-V
      % Mhh forgot what else
    \item History of booting on RISC-V
      % Explain how RISC-V was initially booted,
      % How U-Boot has become the default and how Edk2 can possibly become the second default
      % Also mention oreboot as a recent mature implementation
    \item History of the implementation
      % Explain the history, how Abner got started in 2016
      % how he implemented a PC-AT version of RISC-V in qemu and abandoned it
      % How OpenSBI revived it
      % How we upstreamed it in 2020
      % And how we're currently working on and upstreaming Linux support
    \item Architecture of EDK2 on RISC-V
      % Self-explaining
    \item Booting to Linux
      % Explain the steps that were required to make Linux boot
      % and show the details
    \item Full Details of Booting on Hifive Unleashed and QEMU
      % Quickly go through all of the details to give an walkthrough from beginning to end
    \item Demo booting to Linux
      % Prove that it works
    \item Goals for the future of this implementation
      % List and explain concrete issues and TODO items for us and other's who want to help
      % Call to action
    \item Vision for the future
      % Explain that we want to make RISC-V boot like current systems
      % Like the ARM people say "make booting boring"
